# Flow Type Checking

Flow type checking is optional by file. Simply append the following comment to the top of a file to open it to type checking:

```js
// @flow
```

The flow docs are [here](https://flow.org/en/docs/), and docs for integrating with text editors can be found [here](https://flow.org/en/docs/editors/).

To run flow, simply type `yarn flow` in the command line.
