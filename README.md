# README

This tool sets up boilerplate on top of a fresh Create React App install, installing and integrating:

- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- Connected React Router
- SCSS
- ESlint
- CircleCI
- Netlify

As well as some homemade tools:

- A breakpoint reducer/wrapper
- A file for generating components

And optionally:

- Netlify Functions

### Usage

You'll generally want to run the latest version, so:

```
cd project-directory
npx react-plus-plus
```

> This package makes a large number of file changes. Be sure to commit first, in case you want to easily revert some of them.


### TODO

Some features I hope to add:

- Optionally: Immutable integration
- SASS Lint
- Testing boilerplate and setup
